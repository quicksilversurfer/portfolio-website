           <p>
            Concept Nation is a startup in India whose mission is to become a platform for people to share and discover ideas that are popular in the zeitgeist and a space for artists to sell and promote their work.
           </p>
           <p>
             General users, 'Citizens' can create concepts based on a theme where 'Artists' can post their relevant artwork into. Concepts are ideas and a collection of artwork based around a theme, anything from general topics like nature, moods and social issues to private topics like personal events.
           </p>
           <p>
             Vibhu, the founder, approached me initially to update the current design, since Concept Nation had been up for some time and was getting some traction. There were also issues with users understanding the value proposition of the platform which he also wanted to address.

                The goal was to further develop the MVP, setting up a foundation for further explorations and understand where the real value of the platform lay.

              To understand the current user base and audience, Vibhu and I looked at statistics from Google Analytics. We wanted to map the entry and exit pages, identify key pages that users were interacting and what were the behaviors of the most engaged users.

                  Less than 1 % of users were creating Concepts – Lack of clarity about how the platform worked.

                  Primarily referral traffic - Users were engaging on social platforms, and were coming in directly to internal pages.

                I also did an assessment of the current design to become familiar with the UI and information architecture to identify areas where we could quickly improve upon. I identified the following areas which needed to be tackled - 
              </p>
              <ul class="media-list">
                  <li>
                      Create navigational structures that help the user identify content (concept vs. artwork) and understand where they are in the platform.
                    </li>
                  <li>
                    Create a consistent and scalable visual language by harmonizing the layout, the use of color, typography.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Lastly, allow for serendipitous discovery by showcasing relevant content at the right places in a user's journey.

                <h3>Building</h3>
                <p>
                  Understanding that we wanted to communicate the platforms mission to the audience, I developed some wireframes to communicate my approach to Vibhu and soon after started building. We performed some quick iterations on the visual design and had something that we were satisfied with quite early.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I built the application using Bootstrap framework, as it was the most updated and modern web framework at the time. We managed to get a lot of work completed, part of which is shown below.
