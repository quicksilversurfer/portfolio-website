             Map.it is a concept part of a bigger design brief called Buy Mobile, that our Interaction Design batch tackled at Domus for the Experience Design course. 
           </p>
           <p>
             The challenge was to envision experiences for multi-channel retail services of the future in context of transition spaces and transportation systems. Retail businesses are looking for innovative service models to give them a competitive edge in today's fast paced digital marketplaces. Our batch came up with 5 concepts by 3 project teams to envision such a future.

            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>
              What are transitory spaces? Marc Augé offers some insights about these environments and refers to them as "non-places", a neologism coined in his work with the same title. 
            </p>
            <p>
              He defines them as spaces of transience where the human beings remain anonymous and that do not hold enough significance to be regarded as "places". They are generally hard to name and lack characterization and they offer us only their "instructions of use", which may be prescriptive ("Take the right hand lane"), prohibitive ("No Smoking") or informative. Examples of non-places would be motorways, hotel rooms, airports and shopping malls.
            </p>
            <p>
              He brings up the example of a passenger at the airport waiting in the airport lounge, there are thousands like him there but they are not related. He is only an element of the space governed by the rules of the environment that he is in. The space of non-place creates neither singular identity nor relations, only solitude, and similitude.

           <p>
             With this fresh perspective on transitory spaces, we conducted contextual inquiries in Milano's transit system - metro stations and tram stops. Our goal was to understand a commuters needs, behaviors and also to capture what interactions and businesses these spaces were composed of.  
           </p>
           <p>
             We developed three personas and tried to map their behaviors on activity maps that we created based on our contextual inquiries. These helped us in our process to generate concepts and also analyze their potential effectiveness.

             I had also observed during our contextual inquiries that commuters often seemed bored, or occupied with activities they needed to fill their time with. There was certainly an opportunity to make better use of this time, and more importantly to make better use of the route that they were taking to accomplish other goals besides getting from point A to point B.

           <h3>Concept</h3>
           <p>
             A service which helps the user navigate his or her environment more contextually rather than just taking them from point a to point b. It does this by gathering information about the users routines, and preferences gathered from other social platforms or direct inputs from the user.

           <p>
             When a user signs up for Map.it, the application integrates with existing social media accounts and automatically creates a wish list. The user may categorize and rank these items based on importance, or add new items. 
           </p>
           <p>
             As the user moves about, Map.it learns about the user's commute and important locations. Using this data, the system can recommend new routes along which the user may be able discover items on their wish list or get tasks done. The user can also save, share and rank the suggested routes.
