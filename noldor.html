           <p>
             Love Therapy is a fashion brand started by Elio Fiorucci, a renowed fashion designer and founder of the Fiorucci fashion label. Kobalt Entertainment, our client, had acquired the rights to one of their most iconic characters, a gnome.
           </p>
           <p>
              We had to create, design and deliver these micro-experiences to Kobalt Entertainment, for the commercial exploitation of intellectual property rights for Love Therapy.

            <p>
              We started by identifying the strengths of both Kobalt and Love Therapy in order to plot out opportunities that can be explored by their collaboration.

            <p>
              After our initial brainstorm, we came up with 4 different themes which we wanted to dive into further.
            </p>
            <ol class="media-list">
              <li>Environement Tracking + Improvement</li>
              <li>Education</li>
              <li>Personal Health</li>
              <li>Social  + Communication</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              We researched the products and the upcoming technologies and startups in these areas and tried to identify their potential and shortcomings. For each sector chosen we came up with quick ideas iduring brainstorm sessions.
            </p>
            <p>
              We narrowed down our ideas and decided to focus in the direction of Education and Communication. We believed that these domains had a lot of opportunity that Kobalt Entertainment could leverage to their benefit.

            <p>
              After the exploration on domains we decided that we would be focusing on Education as our domain of choice and started with more concentrated research in that area.

              Some of the ideas we pursued was an experimentation kit for children, a digital toy similar to Tamagotchi and other digitally connected experiences. We dropped most of these realizing the business limitations required to develop these ideas, and also considering how they would fit into the Kobalt Entertainment portfolio.
            </p>
            <p>
              But as we looked into the research done in the education sector we came across some interesting findings.

            <h3>Focusing</h3>
            <p>
              Although activities of children are slowly changing and adopting digital tools, there is still a huge preference amongst parents for printed books. We visited several book stores and confirmed these insights by talking to parents who we met there. We also had discussions about what kind of expereinces they were looking for to share with their children and what's most important to them for their child's development.

            <p>
              Our excursions into bookstores also gave us an opportunity to analyze some of the competitors in the childrens section and the different types of books that are sold. Browsing online marketplaces like the Amazon, iOS and, Android we took note of the top sellers in the educational app categories and tried to identify their biggest selling points.

            <h3>Concept</h3>
            <p>
              ‘Draw Me A Story’ is a digital storytelling experience, which weaves in traditional paper based activities and games that children enjoy, in order to create a more enriching and personalized narrative.
            </p>

          <div class="small-12 medium-10 large-8 cell">
            <blockquote>

          <div class="small-12 medium-8 large-6 cell">

            <p>
             Traditional activities and games like ‘Color the Scene’, ‘Connect the Dots’ or ‘Solve the Maze’ would contribute to the actual narrative and aesthetics of the story. The digital medium could also support novel forms of interaction like singing along with the character or recording your own song as the story played out.
            </p>
            <p>
              The end result would be a rich and highly personalized digital story that could be replayed and shared amongst family and friends.

            <h3>Design Artifacts</h3>
            <p>The experience is composed of two main parts - the completion of the activity book and the storytelling experience available on mobiles and tablets.</p>
            <p>
              We envisioned the activity book experience to be an individual experience for the child, which would foster learning, focus and provide developmental benefits like hand eye coordintation. Children would be motivated by the fact that the effort they make in completing the activity book will be rewarded later with a storytelling experience. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The storytelling experience could be a shared experience with the parent and child, where they would scan in the pages from the activity book to progress the narrative. For example, if the gnome is stuck in a labyrinth, the child would have to solve the maze which would allow the gnome to move on with the story. Similarly if the child colors a scene someway, the story could incorporate the color scheme into the story.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also thought of some interesting educational themes and gnome characters to develop stories.
