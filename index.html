              Hello,
              I'm Prateek. <br> I am an User Experience designer at Siemens Healthcare, where I am leading the redesign of a medical device doing project management and end to end design execution.
            </p>
            <p class="sub-text">
              I believe in creating meaningful solutions that are useful, usable and pleasurable to use.  
            </p>
            <p class="sub-text">
              I enjoy the depth and breadth of knowledge that is required to get design right and constantly strive to develop my understanding of the systems that they are created in.
            </p>
            <p class="sub-text">
              I am grateful for the opportunities my work provides me to evolve, and to create with people who I can learn from and share my perspective with.

              Front end development acted as a bridge when I decided to transition from engineering into design. Most of it was self taught and I possess a practical level understanding of front end frameworks and JavaScript based libraries.

              A Master in Interaction Design, at Domus Academy was my first formal introduction to design thinking, where I had the chance to create innovative yet pragmatic solutions to broad and challenging design briefs.
