           <p>
            During my 6 month internship, I was part of small team of multidisciplinary designers that functioned as an internal design consultancy, employed by different business areas of Siemens Healthcare.
           </p>
           <p>
              During my time there I had the opportunity to  contribute to live projects dealing with the design and development of medical devices used for Radiology. The timing of my internship was quite favorable, in the sense that I got to contribute to the closing phases of one project and the beginnings of another. My work included front end development in XAML, synthesis, concept generation, and prototyping.
           </p>
           <p>
             Because of the confidential nature of the work I cannot share details of my internship , but my intention here is to share what I learned and re-observed in practice some aspects of the design process - a humble retrospective of my internship.

            <h3>1. Simulate context of use</h3>
            <p>
              For a recently completed visual update of the interface, the plan was to provide the development team with a XAML based front end framework. I worked alongside a visual designer, in tweaking the final visual guideline and developing a framework that covered all components, layouts and behaviors to ensure they were implemented as intended and could be reused or modified as necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
              Understanding of the context of use was important in two ways during this activity, one, the choice of colors used in the interface needed to work in both light and dark environments, something that was learned through earlier contextual inquiries. The other, which was a bit frustrating and unexpected was that the actual hardware rendered colors in a completely different hue than the hardware that we had been using. We ended up tweaking the entire color schmea to maintain a consistent visual feel across the UI as it spanned multiple screens. 
            </p>
            <p>
              This was a simple reminder about the importance of understanding the environment of use and how good process involves early testing to avoid unforeseen issues late into the development cycle.

            <h3>2. Be lean</h3>
            <p>
              In an ideal world, a designer would have access to a fairly large user group sitting right around the corner, who they could consult, brainstorm, and test with. This is especially true when you're designing complicated medical devices, learning the use cases for which might get you through medical school. And getting actual users in this domain can get expensive and time consuming fairly quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
              For smaller features which could not warrant an external user research session, we planned mini-workshops with clinical sales specialists from different regions to get a more nuanced understanding of what needs and challenges that current users have.
            </p>
            <p>
              These workshops were crucial in giving us enough context to build solutions that we could confidently test in larger usability sessions, and get valuable feedback which could be iterated upon later.
            </p>
            <p>
              Seeing this lean mindset work so effectively in practice definitely broadened my perspective on how research can be approached and executed. I also find it quite interesting of how limitations, in our case the shortage of resources, can push us to be more creative and become aware of opportunities that we did not think existed before.

            <h3>3. Visualize complexity</h3>
            <p>
              It's easy to get overwhelmed with data that is collected during the design process, from user research, feedback from stakeholders and documentation of behaviors and functionality.
            </p>

              Diving into the chaos of information to discover patterns and create more intuitive structures is a crucial role that we must play as designers.

                In the conceptualization phase, we created several representations of user workflows, and existing behaviors of the device to help us think about the system holistically. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Visualizing this information in simple, approachable chunks of information helped us create a structure that we could think about in the abstract and compare with other interaction models and patterns that we were more familiar with.

            <h3>4. Adapt</h3>
            <p>
             In the second half of my internship, my main task involved supporting the development of UI prototypes which we had finalized based on our explorations in the conceptualization phase. The concepts ranged from conservative to forward thinking as we wanted to get a broad understanding of user preferences for layouts and functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
              We decided to build using Flash, because of it's familiarity of use with other team members and also it's capabilities to work fluidly across multiple screens. The prototypes were receiving data from a physical control panel through a WPF application and gesture data from a smartphone that was being used as a trackpad. I was responsible for building part of the Flash application, integration and finalizing the builds for the different prototypes.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wasn't familiar with any of these tools, but I knew I could reuse my knowledge of JavaScript and had some support from team members. It was a lot of work that was completely new to me, but I was motivated by the thought of working on something radically new and the oppourtunity to further explore what our users needed.
