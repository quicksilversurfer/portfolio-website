<h1 id="helloworld">Hello World</h1>

<p>Thank you for stopping by. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m Prateek, an Interaction Designer at Siemens Healthcare. I am part of small team based in Princeton, NJ, where we work on the design of medical devices and interfaces that form a part of the various prodcuts and digital services that Siemens Healthcare offers. </p>

<p>During my time here I have had the opportunity to act as a design lead for the redesign of a M1 market radiology device, and am currently working on creating a UI design system that is aimed to span across the entirety of the Siemens Healthcare product portfolio.</p>

<p>You can find my work experience and education journey below. I&#8217;d love to hear from you and you can reach out to me at - hello@prateeksolanki.com.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
