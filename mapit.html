            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>
              What are transitory spaces? Marc Augé offers some insights about these environments and refers to them as "non-places", a neologism coined in his work with the same title. 
            </p>
            <p>
              He defines them as spaces of transience where the human beings remain anonymous and that do not hold enough significance to be regarded as "places". 
            </p>
            <p>
              He brings up the example of a passenger at the airport waiting in the airport lounge, there are thousands like him there but they are not related. He is only an element of the space governed by the rules of the environment that he is in. The space of non-place creates neither singular identity nor relations, only solitude, and similitude.

           <h3 class=>User Research</h3>
           <p>
             With this fresh perspective on transitory spaces, we conducted contextual inquiries in Milano's transit system - metro stations and tram stops. Our goal was to understand a commuters needs, behaviors and also to capture what interactions and businesses these spaces were composed of.  
           </p>
           <p>
             We developed three personas and tried to map their behaviors on activity maps that we created based on our contextual inquiries. These helped us in our process to generate concepts and also analyze their potential effectiveness.

           <h3>Synthesis</h3>
           <p>
             We derived some key insights from our user research which we used as as guide during our ideation phase.
           </p>
           <ul class="media-list">
             <li>
               Most of the people were taking their daily commute from one particular station to another and almost never changed or modified the traveling routine.
             </li>
             <li>
               People expect any digital service to be 'smart', one step ahead of their needs, helping them make their lives more efficient.
             </li>
             <li>
               Lastly, commuters hoped that new services can help them discover relevant products and not bombard them with advertising.
             </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
             As we discussed our research and insights with our course leaders, a comment in one of our discussions made a lasting impression on me. 
           </p>

             I had also observed during our contextual inquiries that commuters often seemed bored, or occupied with activities they needed to fill their time with. There was certainly an opportunity to make better use of this time, and more importantly to make better use of the route besides getting from point A to point B.

           <p>
             A service which helps the user navigate his or her environment more contextually rather than just taking them from point a to point b. It does this by gathering information about the users routines, and preferences gathered from other social platforms or direct inputs from the user.

           <p>
             When a user signs up for Map.it, the application integrates with existing social media accounts and automatically creates a wish list. The user may categorize and rank these items based on importance, or add new items. 
           </p>
           <p>
             As the user moves about, Map.it learns about the user's commute and important locations. Using this data, the system can recommend new routes along which the user may be able discover items on their wish list or get tasks done. The user can also save, share and rank the suggested routes.

              <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>
                As platform, Map.it tries to capture a person's needs and lifestyle in a single location and represent these interests onto their local environment. Rather than supporting a person in finding something, Map.it tries to intelligently suggest. Optimizing the routes for people, helping them become more productive, efficient and aware of their surroundings and the possibilities that their cities offer. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Consumers get appropriate solutions, optimized in a way that fits their schedule. Businesses have a chance to target a primed and distributed audience with a higher success rate of conversion. And for cities, a place to showcase it's rich history, culture, and the interests of it's residents.
